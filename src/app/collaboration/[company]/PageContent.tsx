        I worked at Renishaw as a Software Engineer in the CMM Software team. I was responsible for developing software
        for the Renishaw Equator, a gauging system that is used to measure the dimensions of manufactured parts. My main
        responsibilities included developing software for the Equator, writing automated tests, and fixing bugs in the
        software.

        I worked on a variety of projects during my time at Renishaw. One of the projects I worked on was the
        development of a new feature for the Equator software that allowed users to create custom reports. I was
        responsible for designing and implementing the feature, as well as writing automated tests to ensure that it
        worked correctly. I also worked on fixing bugs in the Equator software, which involved investigating the cause
        of the bug, developing a fix, and testing the fix to ensure that it resolved the issue.

        to work with a talented team of engineers, who provided me with valuable feedback and guidance. Overall, my time
        at Renishaw was a valuable learning experience, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked there.
